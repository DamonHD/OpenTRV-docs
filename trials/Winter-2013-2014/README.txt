DHD20130701

This is a trial to attempt to get objective data on the ability (or not) of OpenTRV
to save energy (and not be hated) in normal households.

This trial may be conducted with the help of the Kingston University Smart Communities team

http://www.smartcommunities.org.uk/
Prof Ruth Rettie
Dr Kevin Burchell

and possibly some of their participating householders,
as well as members of the OpenTRV developers team in some cases.
