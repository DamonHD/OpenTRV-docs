OpenTRV - providing technology to revolutionise the way we heat our homes.

IoT / Cites / Stack


Here to save the planet: up to 8% of EU's entire carbon footprint on 500m radiators.

For that we need to be cheap (target GBP10/rad, payback in one winter).

For that we need to be open and interoperable.

For that we need IoT.


IoT Review

  * Lots of sensors (and some actuators)
    Business case: "If you can't measure, you can't manage..."

  * Internet often though not always involved
    OpenTRV's "home LAN" need not touch the Internet but the tech is the same when it does.

  * Lowest power things (smallest, cheapest) cannot directly support Internet sensibly
    Eg 22kB for IPv4 UDP on AVR.
    Which implies concentrators.
    Also militates against meshing.

  * Big pending issues: we're hoping to contribute over next 12 months!
    Standards/interop in data and comms.
    Security.


IoT in Cities

  * IoT Launchpad
    Buses (public transport generally), air, env key targets of IoT.
    Building health is another.
    Fine-grained monitoring such as temps and PMs may be hugely helpful.
    Preferably fit-and-forget, eg self-powered where mains not available.
    Cheap (and not worth nicking), secure, safe, reliable and accurate enough, open.


IoT Stack

  * 80% of IoT value and people in s/w side.
    Not everyone could or should wield at soldering iron.
    OpenTRV contribution is founders with experience all the way up the stack.
    Like being back in Personal Robots days with Z80A but with EEPROM, radio and nice IDE!
