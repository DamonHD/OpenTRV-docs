The 8th Annual Internet of Things European Summit (2017/04/20): Abstract

Tech Talk: Cutting energy cost and carbon footprint with IoT



OpenTRV has a mission to knock several percent off Europe's
entire carbon footprint by 2050, and IoT turns out to be a key
component of its strategy.  OpenTRV is targeting home heating
efficiency with its simple solution with a one year financial payback
targeting the current 50% wasted energy money and carbon,
and without sacrificing privacy or making lives more complicated.
OpenTRV sees that energy efficiency almost of necessity implies
complexity, which people already don't deal with well, and which IoT
can help tackle.
