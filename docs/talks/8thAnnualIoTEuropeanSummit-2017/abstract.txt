The 8th Annual Internet of Things European Summit (2017/04/20): Abstract

Tech Talk: Cutting energy cost and carbon footprint with IoT

Saving real money (and carbon) for real people
not just fat rich blokes obsessed with tech.

IoT will have come of age when, at least in the home,
it's stuff that "just works" and that eases the complexity of everyday living,
as well as for example improving comfort and cutting down on bills.

OpenTRV has been working on taking the pain and cost out of home heating,
with savings of hundreds of Euros per home per year possible,
while improving comfort and letting people get on with things important to them,
and without sacrificing privacy or requiring a smartphone...

But we're also having fun with bus shelters and energy harvesting.
