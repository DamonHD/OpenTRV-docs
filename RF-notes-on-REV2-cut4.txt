2014/07/03: discussing possible CE-stamp RF problems on IRC...

[21:40] mikestir    yes looking at it it's not great in terms of ground plane, but it's not exactly a speed demon
[21:41] mikestir    I can't see it being a big problem
[21:41] mikestir    also the rf track isn't
[21:41] mikestir    and the tracks are _still_ unnecessarily thin
[21:41] mikestir    I've given up telling you about that though
[21:42] DamonHD I did try to widen them a little but we were having trouble routing.
[21:42] DamonHD And all the supply tracks are now much wider than they were in their own net class.
[21:42] Boelle_DK   *me hides*
[21:42] DamonHD And we're way above iTEAD and PMS limits.
[21:43] mikestir    the ground plane thing just needs some stitching vias so you don't have it cut up into slots
[21:43] mikestir    slots are bad - they act as antennas
[21:43] DamonHD Doesn't that risk ground loops?
[21:43] mikestir    no - you have a ground loop as it is
[21:43] mikestir    look at that thin section of ground on the top layer that goes all the way around the bottom edge
[21:44] mikestir    if you have narrow sections like that and you can't stitch it you need to make sure there's a break at one end
[21:45] DamonHD So stitching / multiple routes is OK.
[21:45] DamonHD ?
[21:45] mikestir    yes
[21:45] DamonHD OK.
[21:45] DamonHD Good to know. Thanks.
[21:45] mikestir    what you don't want is a pair of ground tracks on either side with a via at each end
[21:45] mikestir    if you stick vias all the way along you don't have a loop any more
[21:46] mikestir    the vias and the tiny sections in between have such low resistance and inductance that they cease to matter
[21:47] mikestir    your antenna track should really be designed as a coplanar waveguide with stitching vias along the adjoining ground plane, but it's so short you probably don't need to care about that - what you have is probably fine

[21:47] DamonHD Good!
[21:48] mikestir    http://www.mike-stirling.com/gallery3/index.php/HAB/DSC_2396
[21:48] mikestir    look at the rf layout on that

[21:48] mikestir    that could probably use more stitching vias but I wanted to be kind to the fab, and it works fine
