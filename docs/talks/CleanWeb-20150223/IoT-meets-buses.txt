CleanWeb "Transport": IoT Meets Buses
DHD20150223

Q: If you could choose one or two sensors to put in all the bus shelters on your most-used route,
   what would they be and why, and are there any ethical/security/privacy issues?

Talk:

  * Saving the planet (and your hairdo): PMs, NOx CO2

  * Cheap, robust, micro-power, open sensors and backhaul (backed out of OpenTRV) == IoT

  * Footfall: currently largely unknown in real time (and ad targeting!)

  * Other environmental measurements, eg fine-grid temperature may be useful to Met Office, also air quality

  * Journey planning and adjustment of capacity for demand in real-time

  * 22k bus stops in London, 395k in UK
